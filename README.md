Lesson 1: we've created our first component using an older method called Class components.

My opinion: Overall, it's easier to work with Function Components. Also, there's less verbose and it's easier to read and understand.

Research about the topic: as function components became more and more popular, React team shifted updates to improve its features, allowing stateful components to be declared as function components. On earlier stages, React didn't support stateful function components, meaning its usage of it was limited to stateless components. Developers used Class components when their projects required some state change. That changed dramatically and moving forward React developers tends to use fewer to no Class Components.

Lesson 2: we've created our Form component using input for text and time and imported and placed our Button component inside its rendering tree.

Lesson 3: we've created a List components to show a topic of study and its timer. The next step is to dinamically show our list items.
